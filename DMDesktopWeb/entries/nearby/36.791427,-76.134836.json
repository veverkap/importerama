I had to do this run today since I am leaving for PA in the morning to pick up my hubby, he's been in PA for 2 weeks visiting this family. And I knew there would be no way to get this one in while I was up there.  So I headed out at 8am and it was real nice, I had my layers on and I wasn't cold in fact I shedded the top one after 1 mile and tied it around my waist. I got in 9.85 miles in before it started to snow only problem was I was 9.85 miles from home, almost to the beach!! So I turned around and it started to come down and it got cold so I put my hoodie back on and put the hood up and continued on. I can't even describe how good I felt, the snow was falling and it was beautiful. But by the 16th mile things were starting to get bad, cars were skidding and I was getting nervous because I'm sure they weren't expecting a runner to be out there. But I needed 22 so I continued on. At mile 19 my shoes were so caked with snow my feet were cramping from trying to run in an unnatural way and my sweatshirt must have weighed 10 pounds as it was starting to get soaked! So I made it back to my house and my GPS only said 21.03 but couldn't stay outside any longer so I went inside and took off the wet clothes and jumped on the treadmill for 1 more mile!! Yahoooo, 22 I DID IT!!!  I was too frozen to attempt an ice bath so I know my legs will be killing me tomorrow but I'm going for a massage in the morning before I leave so that should help. The good news was I held a pace lower than my marathon pace for 16+ miles until the conditions got so bad and I had to slow down and wait quite a bit to cross streets.  Right now I feel like I could take on the world!!!","likes":[]},{"location":{"name":"Chesapeake, VA"},"comments":[{"created_at":"2010-12-16T22:56:20Z","body":"Let's!","user":{"username":"RunnerRee","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/RunnerRee","photo_url":"http://s3.dmimg.com/pictures/users/128003/1282739674_avatar.jpg","display_name":"Marie"}},{"created_at":"2010-12-16T23:12:25Z","body":"I'm in","user":{"username":"Nurseontherun","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/Nurseontherun","photo_url":"http://s3.dmimg.com/pictures/users/62574/1288921061_avatar.jpg","display_name":"Lou Ann W."}},{"created_at":"2010-12-16T23:23:26Z","body":"I'm in...if I am allowed to run by then!","user":{"username":"dannyweatherly","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/dannyweatherly","photo_url":"http://s3.dmimg.com/pictures/users/132854/1288959023_avatar.jpg","display_name":"Danny W."}},{"created_at":"2010-12-16T23:24:05Z","body":"I'm in but only nights and weekends! :-)","user":{"username":"CharlesP","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/CharlesP","photo_url":"http://s3.dmimg.com/pictures/users/44570/1289003734_avatar.jpg","display_name":"Charlie P."}},{"created_at":"2010-12-16T23:44:06Z","body":"Let's do this thing","user":{"username":"ShepDog","url":"http://www.dailymile.com/people/ShepDog","photo_url":"http://s1.dmimg.com/pictures/users/119373/1291073694_avatar.jpg","display_name":"Steve Shep"}},{"created_at":"2010-12-16T23:49:01Z","body":"For sure!
